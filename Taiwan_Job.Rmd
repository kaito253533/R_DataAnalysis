## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
```{r}
Average_101 <- read.csv("/Users/lexi/Documents/DataAnalysis/Taiwan_Job/101年_青年勞工現職工作平均每月薪資.csv")
Average_103 <- read.csv("/Users/lexi/Documents/DataAnalysis/Taiwan_Job/103年_青年勞工現職工作平均每月薪資.csv")
Average_105 <- read.csv("/Users/lexi/Documents/DataAnalysis/Taiwan_Job/105年_青年勞工現職工作平均每月薪資.csv")
```

```{r}
Average_101_M <- Average_101[1,13]
Average_101_F <- Average_101[2,13]

Average_103_M <- Average_103[1,13]
Average_103_F <- Average_103[2,13]

Average_105_M <- Average_105[1,12]
Average_105_F <- Average_105[2,12]

M_Average <- c(Average_101_M, Average_103_M, Average_105_M)
F_Average <- c(Average_101_F, Average_103_F, Average_105_F)

Total_Average <- c(M_Average, F_Average)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
dat <- data.frame(
  Sex = factor(c("Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female")),
  Year = factor(c("2012","2014","2016"), levels=c("2012","2014","2016")),
  Average = Total_Average
)
dat

ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=Year, y=Average, group=Sex, colour=Sex)) +
    geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
